This is Fusillade, a load testing tool written using the Go programming language. ðŸš€

Some key notes:
If you already have a Go binary file sorted and ready for your computer architecture, then you can skip to point three.

1. Make sure your computer has Go installed.
2. Clone this repo into your Go /src directory.
3. Open and read the Fusillade_user_manual.pdf file or the user_manual_text.rtf file. These will show you how to get up and running.
